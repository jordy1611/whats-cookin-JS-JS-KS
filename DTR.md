# DTR: Define the Relationship

### Guiding Questions to Define the Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

Divide and conquer and pair programming when we are incorporating each other code or if issues seem to arise.

* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?

As a team we have a good set of strength, organization, logic, communication, and clean coding practices.


* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?

Communicate first and make sure the team is always on the same page and in constant communication.

* How will we overcome obstacles?

Use resources from class, MDN, mentor.


* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?


* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?


* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?

Make sure it is constructive, and thoughtful not hurtful. We are all trying to grow and supporting each other is key.

* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?

GitHub Projects, slack


* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?

Take a step back, do some research or reach out to the cohort, rock, or a mentor to help get through the problem.


* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?

We all walked away learning something new, and honing our existing skills, and becoming more fluid.

* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

Celebrating our wins, take a moment to look at what we have accomplished every time we work on the project. Also taking a moment to acknowledge what we both bring to the team.

Any additional questions that you would like to add:


### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)

A quiet organized work environment, minimizing distractions. Video on and screen sharing making the whole process fell more personable. Notebooks to take notes on project as we go.

* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could interfere with your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those issues? (Examples: my kids, my dog, my partner, etc.) 

Somethings that could interfere would be unruly animals, or surprise guest which shouldn’t happen at a time like this.

* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype. 

* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?

We will be using befocused to keep track of pomodoros, 40 minutes on 10 minutes off, but also willing to take longer breaks if needed or work through if applicable.

* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?

I think it is important to take a moment at the beginning and end of each session of project time to check in on each other and keep clear healthy communication.


### Template for DTR Memo

Project: What's Cookin

Group Member Names: Katy St Sauveur, Jordy Shryock, and Josh Sevy.

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): 
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):


How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

Communication, being able to take a step back and come up with a plan. Using the tools we have to help get over these obsticles. Doing research for us all to learn and grow. 

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section): 

We have decided to work on our project weekdays till 6pm (longer if needed), and weekend early afternoon to work together. 

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

I think it is important to take a moment at the beginning and end of each session of project time to check in on each other and keep clear healthy communication. We will communicate over slack, and slack video chat/ screen share. Keeping in touch often to work through the project.


Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Remote working, utilizing keyboard shortcuts, stronger overall knowledge of JS, HTML, CSS, and TDD.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): 

Professional README.md and using project boards efficiently.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): 

All of these things are going to hugely beneficial. 

Pomodoro Break Schedule: 40 minute on 10 breaks, 20 minute breaks every four. 

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Daily communication, giving quality feedback, and acknowledge our accomplishments after every work session.

Additional Remote Considerations:

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):

GitHub projects, I think will be beneficial to start learning this early to develop a strong knowledge of how a project management tool can help with these projects.

Day 1 Agenda: GitHub Project Board, Project Review, Git setup, Slack Setup, DTR and getting to know one another.
